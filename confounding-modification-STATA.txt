* Create interaction terms

tab diabetesmed
tab hba1c

* Check the distribution of diabetic medication change based on HbA1c levels
tab diabetesmed hba1c

* Fit the full model
logit diabetesmed hba1c admit_source patient_visits padmit hadmit hpatient hpadmit

* To reduce the output, add the nolog option
logit diabetesmed hba1c admit_source patient_visits padmit hadmit hpatient hpadmit, nolog

* Model 1: assessing admission source and patient visits as potential effect modifiers separately

* Check for effect modification
* Drop hpadmit
logit diabetesmed hba1c admit_source patient_visits padmit hadmit hpatient, nolog

* Drop hpatient
logit diabetesmed hba1c admit_source patient_visits padmit hadmit, nolog

* Model 2: Refit the model by dropping all interaction terms between HbA1c levels and admission source 
* and keep the interaction term between HbA1c levels and patient visits.
* Start assessing for confounding
logit diabetesmed hba1c admit_source patient_visits padmit hpatient, nolog

* Model 3: Refit the model by dropping the interaction terms between 
* admission source and patient visits (padmit)
logit diabetesmed hba1c admit_source patient_visits hpatient, nolog

* Model 4: Refit the model by dropping the admission source variable
* Final Model
logit diabetesmed hba1c patient_visits hpatient, nolog

* STATA outputs the confidence intervals for the variables

* Convert the coefficients (log odds ratio) to odds ratio
* To achieve that, I will add the or option to the final model

* First, create the fitted values and call it yh (short for yhat)
predict yh, xb

* Create the plot on the left for figure 9

* Create the plot on the right for figure 9
* Exponentiate the fitted values
gen expyh = exp(yh)

* Create a plot of odds ratio of exposed against unexposed
twoway (line expyh patient_visits if hba1c==0, sort lcolor(blue)lpattern(dash))(line expyh patient_visits if hba1c==1, sort lcolor(blue)),legend(label(1 "unexposed")label(2 "exposed")) xtitle("Number of patient visits") ytitle("Estimated odds") title("Exposed and unexposed odds by patient visits")
