# Confounding-and-Modification-in-Modelling

Have you heard about confounding and modification and would like to learn about it? Or did you click on this link out of curiosity? Then, hold on! This will be a short and precise introduction to understanding confounding and modification in modelling.

Recently, I learnt about confounding and effect modification and the impacts it can have on modelling and interpretation of results. I thought about writing a 3-series article demystifying these concepts including an illustrative example of confounding and effect modification with a case study.

You can read the articles below:

**Article 1:** Confounding and modification in modelling explained [here](https://arimoroolayinka.medium.com/confounding-and-modification-in-modelling-explained-c37dbe7b40ff)

**Article 2:** A case study: Assessing confounding and modification using logistic regression in R [here](https://arimoroolayinka.medium.com/a-case-study-assessing-confounding-and-modification-using-logistic-regression-in-r-and-stata-2be659cbb813)

**Article 3:** The dangers of extrapolation in modelling [here]()

This repository contains the dataset, R and STATA codes used to perform the analysis explained in the articles.
